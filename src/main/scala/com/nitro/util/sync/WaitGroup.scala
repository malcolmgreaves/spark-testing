 * A WaitGroup is a data structure used to synchronize many concurrently
 * executing operations, where the number of executing operations is
 * only known at runtime. This constraint precludes the use of a
 * Java concurrent CountDownLatch as the maximum number of concurrent
 * operations must be specified at compile time.
 *
 * Inspiration for this class, including its API, was motivated by the
 * WaitGroup struct in Go: http://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup
 *
 * NOTE, design decision:
 * Chose as final class since it's highly mutable and shouldn't be mixed-in
 * nor extended. A `WaitGroup` has a incredibly narrow, well-defined purpose.
 * It should not be used for anything else.
